## Challenge 
> Doesn't our logo look cool?

## Solution
I took a closer look at the logo of AlexCTF on the front page.
![Alexflag](https://github.com/R3dCr3sc3nt/AlexCTF/blob/master/TR4-Doesnt_our_logo_look_cool/Alexflag.png)
The flag is hidden in plain sight.
It would be possible to use a python script or even sed to extract the flag but I opted to extract them by hand.
The flag is **ALEXCTF{0UR_L0G0_R0CKS}**.
